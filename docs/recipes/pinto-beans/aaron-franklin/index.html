I was introduced to this recipe by a co-worker but the original recipe can be found at <a href="https://www.homesicktexan.com/pinto-beans-aaron-franklin-barbecue/">Homesick Texan</a></p><h3>Ingredients</h3><ul><li>1 lb dried pinto beans</li><li>1/4 medium yellow onion, diced</li><li>1/4 cup chile powder</li><li>1 tbsp kosher salt</li><li>1 tbsp black pepper</li><li>2 tsp onion powder</li><li>2 tsp garlic powder</li><li>1/4 tsp ground cumin</li><li>1 cup chopped smoked brisket</li></ul><h3>Steps</h3><ol><li>Rinse the pinto beans and remove any rocks. Place the beans, onion, chili powder, salt, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and cumin in a large pot. Cover with 2 inches of water, stir until the spices are well distributed, and then soak the beans uncovered for 8 hours. Alternatively, you can bring the pot to a boil, turn off the heat, cover the pot, and let them quick soak for 1 hour.</li><li>To cook the beans, add the brisket to the pot. (Do not drain the soaking liquid.) You want there to be at least an inch and a half of water above the beans, so add more water to the pot if needed. Bring the pot to a boil, then turn down the heat down to low, cover the pot, and then gently simmer for 1 hour.</li><li>After 1 hour, remove the cover and then continue to cook the beans until they’re tender, which will depend on the age of the beans. This can happen anywhere from 1 hour to 3 hours.</li><li>If you want to make these in the slow cooker, after soaking, cook them covered on low for 6 hours, then remove the lid and continue to cook on low for 2 more hours.</li></ol><h3>Notes</h3><p>If you’re not using kosher salt but table salt or sea salt instead, reduce the amount of salt to 1 tablespoon, otherwise the beans may be too salty.</p><p><a href="/index.html">Home</a></p></div></article>

*   1 tsp baking soda
*   1 tsp vanilla extract
*   2 tbsp stevia or other 0 cal sweetener
*   2 tsp milk

### Steps

1.  Mix all dry ingredients together in a bowl
2.  Mix all wet ingredients in a separate bowl
3.  While stirring, slowly pour the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients
4.  Line a baking pan with parchment paper and put the mix into the pan

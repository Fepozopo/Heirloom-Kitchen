### Description

This is a recipe for candied cherry cookies. It is a family recipe that my grandma would make every year. The cookies are soft and chewy, with a sweet cherry flavor. They are perfect for the holidays or any special occasion.

### Ingredients

* 1 cup butter
* 1 cup powdered sugar
* 1 egg
* 1 tsp vanilla
* 2 1/4 cups flour
* 1 cup pecan halves
* 2 cups candied cherries


### Steps

1. Cream butter and sifted sugar
2. Add egg and vanilla, mix well
3. Gradually add flour, mixing until combined
4. Fold in pecans and candied cherries (cut in half)
5. Divide dough into thirds
6. Shape into rolls 12 inches long
7. Wrap in waxed paper and chill for at least 3 hours
8. Cut into 1/8 inch slices and place on ungreased cookie sheet
9. Bake at 325 for 13-15 minutes until delicately browned on edges

### Notes

My grandma would always make these without the pecans, and they were still delicious, so you can leave them out if you prefer. Additionally, you can experiment with different types of nuts.
